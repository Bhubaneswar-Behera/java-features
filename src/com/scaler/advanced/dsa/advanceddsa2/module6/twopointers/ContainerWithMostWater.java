/**
 * Given N non-negative integers A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1] ,
 * where each represents a point at coordinate (i, A[i]).
 * N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, A[i]) and (i, 0).
 * Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container,
 * such that the container contains the most water. You need to return this maximum area.
 * Note: You may not slant the container. It is guaranteed that the answer will fit in integer limits.
 *
 * Input : A = [1, 5, 4, 3]  Output : 6
 * Explanation : 5 and 3 are distance 2 apart.
 * So size of the base = 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3.
 * So total area = 3 * 2 = 6
 *
 * Input : A = [1]           Output : 0
 * Explanation : No container is formed.
